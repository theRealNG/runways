# Runways

Runways is a gRPC based ruby application. It will setup the basic project structure with active_record ORM.

## Installation

Install Runways at the command prompt:

    $ gem install runways

Create a new runways application:

		$ runways hello

Run the following rake task to update protobuf files:
```ruby
	rake protobuf_files:update
```
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
