# Runways
Runways is a gRPC based ruby application. It will setup the basic project structure with active_record ORM.

## Installation

Install Runways at the command prompt:

  $ gem install runways

Create a new runways application:

  $ runways new hello

Run the following rake task to update protobuf files:

```ruby
	rake protobuf_files:update
```

Run the following command to start the server, the server will reload if any file is changed

```ruby
  APP_ENV=development rerun -- ruby SERVER_FILE.rb
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
